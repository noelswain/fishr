\title{Calculate Biomass Index}
\usage{
biomass_index(cpue = NULL, area_swept, catch = NULL, effort = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{cpue}{Numeric vector of CPUE values. If \code{catch} and \code{effort} are
provided, this is computed automatically.}

\item{area_swept}{Numeric vector of area swept (e.g., km²)}

\item{catch}{Optional numeric vector of catch. If provided with \code{effort},
CPUE is computed via \code{cpue()}.}

\item{effort}{Optional numeric vector of effort. Required if \code{catch} is
provided.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{cpue()} when computing from
catch and effort (e.g., \code{method}, \code{gear_factor}).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of biomass index values
}
\description{
Calculates biomass index from CPUE and area swept. Can optionally
compute CPUE from catch and effort data.
}
\examples{
# From pre-computed CPUE
biomass_index(cpue = 10, area_swept = 5)

# Compute CPUE on the fly
biomass_index(area_swept = 5, catch = 100, effort = 10)

# Pass method through to cpue()
biomass_index(
  area_swept = 5,
  catch = c(100, 200),
  effort = c(10, 20),
  method = "log"
)
}
